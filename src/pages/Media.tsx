            Our in-class discussions and the media episode "Exterminate All The Brutes" have
illuminated the complex historical reality of the Americas, exploring the exploitative dynamics
established by European discovery, enslavement, and Native American contacts. The media
episode and our conversations both illustrate the different ways that different communities have
experienced exploitation and oppression, as well as the terrible tragedies that European powers
like the Spanish and Portuguese wreaked upon indigenous populations.
The media episode and our class talks bear a remarkable connection in that they both
focus on how the powerful write and shape history. "Whoever wins in the end gets to frame the
story," as the episode rightly notes, illustrates how historical narratives frequently mirror the
viewpoints of the dominant forces while stifling the voices and experiences of the oppressed. In a
similar vein, we discussed the underappreciated history of the Caribbean in class and stressed
how even highly educated people frequently have a poor understanding of its realities. This
emphasizes how powerful dynamics have a pervasive influence on how historical narratives are
shaped.
In addition, the media program and our conversations explore the subject of racial
hierarchy and how it contributes to oppression and exploitation. The show focuses on how
racism spread throughout European nations and became engrained in science, religion, and
culture, among other spheres of life. Similar to this, we discussed how non-white and indigenous
groups were routinely exploited and violently oppressed, as well as how their freedoms were
taken away from them.
Another major subject that comes up in our class talks and the media show is slavery. The
episode emphasizes the deep-seated racism and avarice that supported the institution of slavery
by illuminating the violent infrastructures set up by influential European personalities through
historical narratives and visual representations. In a similar vein, we examined in our talks the
political and social institutions that emerged from colonization, conflict, and corruption—all of
which were motivated by the innate racism and greed that characterized European societies.
In conclusion, our in-class talks and the media episode "Exterminate All The Brutes"
provide insightful perspectives into the nuanced historical reality of the Americas. We can better
comprehend historical narrative construction and the long-lasting effects of racism and
colonialism on societies by critically analyzing the processes of power, oppression, and
exploitation. These conversations push us to strive toward a more just and equitable future while
forcing us to face difficult realities about the past.

            We explored the intricacies of how financial organizations may impose a type of
neo-colonialism on sovereign states through lending practices and economic control during our
class discussions on colonization and debt. In Peter James Hudson's "Bankers and Empire: How
Wall Street Colonized the Caribbean," this theme is eloquently illustrated, especially when one
takes into account the historical background of Wall Street's Caribbean expansion and draws
parallels with current issues such as the Canadian World Bank's lending to Haiti.
An egregious example of economic imperialism is presented in Hudson's thorough
account of how Wall Street, driven by banks like Citibank and JPMorgan Chase (Chase
Manhattan as described in lecture), relentlessly expanded their activities in the Caribbean from
the late 19th century until the Great Depression. These organizations engaged in actions that not
only compromised local sovereignty but also opened the door for the exploitation and control of
the Caribbean's economic systems by driving away European rivals and dominating banking,
trade, and finance in the area.
The obvious connection between financial imperialism and military intervention is
further demonstrated by Hudson's account of the U.S. Marines' 1915 deployment to Haiti in
order to stabilize the nation for American financial interests. By imposing loans and financial
governance that benefited the banks at the expense of Haiti's sovereignty and economic stability,
this intervention gave U.S. banks influence over the country's financial system. This historical
incident reflects larger themes of debt manipulation and colonization, in which powerful nations'
financial institutions use debt and financial authority to take advantage of weaker nations.
Comparing this to the lecture, financial imperialism of this kind can be observed in the
Canadian World Bank's lending to Haiti. Such institutions can retain some control over the
economic destiny of countries like Haiti by regulating the flow of money and setting the
parameters of economic development. This keeps these countries stuck in a debt-dependent cycle
that is reminiscent of colonial exploitation practices. This contemporary example is related to the
topics we covered in class regarding how foreign financial institutions' lending practices and
economic policies can be used as instruments of neo-colonialism, controlling the course of the
economy and restricting national sovereignty in the name of aid and development.
These instances of financial imperialism, both historical and modern, bear a greater
significance to themes of colonization, debt, and the power wielded by financial institutions that
we covered in lecture. These dynamics continue to have an impact on international economic
relations. In addition to shedding light on the past, Hudson's investigation of the exploitative and
racially motivated Wall Street banks in the Caribbean provides important new insights into the
complexities and difficulties of dealing with debt, financial dependence, and economic
sovereignty in the modern, globalized world.
Through the lens of "Bankers and Empire," we can examine these themes in a critical
manner, examining the historical foundations of contemporary economic concerns as well as the
effects of current and historical financial activities on the goal of sustainable and equitable
development. This conversation deepens our comprehension of how history, economics, and
colonialism's legacy have shaped the modern world.

            During his Tropical Medicine lecture, Professor Frank Snowden explores the
socio-political foundations of this medical specialty by examining its historical growth and
repercussions. Fundamentally, tropical medicine arose as a response to the perceived special
health risks associated with warm temperatures, especially in former colonial nations. According
to the lecture, this specialized subject experienced substantial changes throughout time that
mirrored adjustments in scientific theories and global power dynamics.
Tropical medicine was a tool of imperialism during its early years in the late 19th and
early 20th centuries. It represented a Eurocentric worldview that portrayed the tropics as
naturally hazardous and disease-ridden. The discipline sometimes overlooked the welfare of
indigenous communities in favor of protecting the health of European settlers and colonial
officials. This particularized worry about the well-being of the ruling class was a reflection of
larger colonial beliefs about racial exploitation and superiority.
The interview also focuses on the scientific discoveries that contributed to the
development of Tropical Medicine, especially in the area of parasitology. The theoretical
underpinning of the field was founded by the pioneering findings of pioneers in the field, such as
Ronald Ross and Patrick Manson, about the transmission of diseases like malaria. These
scientific achievements were used to support and uphold colonial dominance, not to remove
them from their socio-political environment.
Over time, Tropical Medicine underwent changes due to several variables such as
decolonization and priorities in global health. These changes caused the field's focus to broaden
to include public health issues and a more egalitarian approach to disease prevention and
treatment. This transition was made possible by funding initiatives from institutions like as the
World Health Organization and the Rockefeller Foundation, which broke with the discipline's
previous links to colonial interests.
In conclusion, It is clear from the lecture and the readings that go along with it that
Tropical Medicine is a powerful illustration of how medical knowledge is socially constructed
and intertwined with larger power systems. We can better understand the intricate interactions
that exist between politics, science, and human health by critically analyzing its development and
history. In order to ensure that lessons from the past inspire more egalitarian and inclusive
approaches to medical practice and research, it is vital that we examine the legacy of tropical
medicine and its implications for current global health initiatives.

            The weekly media delves into the complex political and economic dynamics of early
1920s Central America, with a special emphasis on Panama, Honduras, and Nicaragua. This was
an unstable time, marked by foreign meddling. The "banana wars" and its ramifications are
clarified by this historical narrative, and these insights connect to the larger topics covered in our
course.
The media describes how world powers like the United States were interested in Central
America due to its strategic importance, especially the possibility of a shipping canal. A pivotal
moment in U.S. participation in the region was the French-initiated and U.S.-completed
construction of the Panama Canal. Motivated by both political and economic concerns, this
intervention set the stage for further U.S. actions in Central America.
Furthermore, the United Fruit Company's ascent to prominence in the area serves as an
example of how corporate interests and geopolitical strategy are intertwined. The region's
political instability and economic imperialism are intricately linked, as demonstrated by United
Fruit's assertive commercial strategies, which include land acquisition and political influence.
The media shows how American military involvement has supported governments that serve
American interests. U.S. Marines' deployment in Honduras and Nicaragua to safeguard
American commercial interests and ensure political stability is indicative of the "Dollar
Diplomacy" strategy employed to uphold American economic dominance in the area.
Imperialism, colonialism, and economic exploitation that we have covered in class. It
demonstrates how strong countries, motivated by economic gain, imposed authority on lesser
governments, frequently at the price of stability and local sovereignty. It also calls into question
the morality of foreign intervention and the long-term effects on the impacted societies of such
measures.
In addition, the media forces us to think about modern similarities, especially in areas
where geopolitical objectives and commercial interests converge. The persistence of historical
lessons in comprehending contemporary global dynamics is demonstrated by the echoes of
previous interventions in current conflicts and power struggles.
In conclusion, the examination of the weekly media highlights the intricate relationship
that has shaped Central American history between political scheming, economic motivations,
and military action. Through placing historical events in the perspective of larger theme
discussions, we are able to better understand the lasting effects of imperialism and the difficulties
associated with advancing sovereignty and development in a globalized world.

            Dr. Monica Jimenez, Courtnee Desiree Morris, and Christopher A. Loperena were the
speakers for the Book Talk on Diaspora Encuentros, featuring their respective books: "To Defend
This Sunrise" and "The Ends of Paradise." They each shared brilliant reflection about their
experiences as leading Black Studies scholars, focusing on native Black communities in Central
America during the interventions. Morris put that in the clear and most important standpoint to
her work, indicating that the Center for Black Studies had been a big part of her academic and
writing life for the last 20 years. She brought with her to impassioned speech the struggles that
the Black population, especially women of Nicaragua, face historically and today, systematically
wronged and asked to blossom in these conditions—an expectation which she found to be a
deeply unjust normalization of profound disjunctures.
Morris focuses on leadership roles that Black women activists play in Nicaragua, which
are illustrative of the problems presented through the geopolitical dynamics in the Caribbean.
She criticizes the modern approach to mestizo multiculturalism as aiming at weakening both the
Black and the Indigenous identities of further inequality and injustice in the first countries that
identify with cultural variety, i.e., Nicaragua. Similarly, "The Ends of Paradise" focuses on
political, industrial, and infrastructural dimensions of Honduras and international actions or
inactions forming an amalgam contributing together for the exclusion of the populations being
Black and Indigenous. The lecture goes to the macabre normalization of the violence even
genocides in these societies, drawing the analogies with the situation in Gaza to raise repressive
tendencies in the world and denial of crises through conventional political propaganda.
In summary, through the discussion, an environmental degradation and forced
displacement scenario that looked like ethnic cleansing vis-à-vis historical and contemporary
struggles of black people around the world was shed light on. There was a need to learn some
important issues concerning the systemic patterns and increase awareness. It underscored the
need for the deep-seated recognition and approach toward the complex systems that allow
powerful groups to escape responsibility, while extending the cycles of injustice and shedding of
blood.

            hrough Michele Stephenson's piercing documentary "Stateless," one can truly
access the state-sanctioned racism that oozes right within the very fabric. Stephenson
threads the historical context with the modern-day politics to bare chilling realities faced
by people when the ultra-ideologies of a government take root, influencing from
bureaucratic processes right down to the living room and street-level interactions. The
documentary is not plain—it is a story about history; this is brightly drawn evidence of
how much systemic racism costs human nature. Many intimate details from lives
dispersed by policies based on identity and belonging bring the piece to be authentic.
Stateless also reflects one-another important mirror of the historical tributaries
through which one looks at the political landscape of today, where racism is not a
political undercurrent but a force seen and felt in governance and structures of society. I
will further analyze the capriccious and cruel face of this type of nationalism guided by
racial hatred through an in-depth analysis of the polemic policies of the Dominican
Republic towards Haitian immigrants and their descendants. This is a story that, though
true, finds another meaning in its universal theme: the dangers of allowing extremist
ideologies to seep into the very fabric of society.
With a story related to the issues discussed this week, Stateless brings grim
reminders of what history has taught us in the areas of racism and exclusion. It equates
with the discussions of the consequences that unlimited powers could produce and the
role of the governments in either fostering a united society or dividing it on the base of
racism and ethnic factors. The documentary could not possibly be more on point in
re-echoing the larger themes of our course, most especially the mechanisms by which
racism is institutionalized and legitimized in the state apparatus through the
generations of individuals who are to be found to be stateless, stripped of rights and
recognition.
In a world amidst renewed national and extremist ideologies, the story of
"Stateless" warns and calls out. It would question the role of leaders, the impact of
policies, and the collective responsibility of society to oppose the seeds of division that
racism sows. It evokes reflection through the viewer to the place of each in these
dynamics and what might be an indictment through the inaction against the most
innocent in society.
Drawing chilling parallels with today's events, Stateless reflects a global rise of
nationalism with the drawing up of borders, tight against migrants and refugees. And
suddenly, it calls into my remembrance what is happening to the Rohingya in Myanmar,
to the Uighurs in China, the never-ending debate of immigration and citizenship in the
USA, etc. Discrimination can be portrayed in a different way in both stories—refusal to
give the play permit and throwing out finally in the other. That is the common underlying
theme shared by the two stories.
The book basically asks the question of what really defines the sense of identity
and belonging in a world that is growingly becoming fragmented along racial and ethnic
divisions.
It prompts the viewer on the effects of the policies of the states that end up excluding
and marginalizing the most vulnerable in the long run, and in so doing, prompts
reflection on the real principles that guide nations in relation to and their treatment of
the most vulnerable in intra- and inter-national affairs. Michele Stephenson's "Stateless"
is in a word powerful for its examination of the lasting reach of state-sanctioned racism
and a timely reminder of the danger it prescribes for its targets and democracy, human
rights in the whole. Reflecting on the deeper meaning of these themes outlined in the
documentary, it is only best that we carry forward the message that one has to remain
vigilant and act as an advocate against the said forces of racism and extremism that
threaten to tear apart the fabric of our societies.

            The last episode of "The Cuba Libre Story" is more illustrative of the post-Soviet era of
Cuba, which serves as the setting for the ever-evolving political environment and international
relations of the island, with its study focused mainly on Venezuela. This episode takes a close
look at how Cuba was able to straddle the very rough political waters of the world after the fall
of the Soviet Union, its one-time ally and major benefactor.
"By Any Means Necessary" features interdependence clear between two countries: Cuba
and Venezuela, among which has been nurtured an alliance, the effects of which mean lots to
both countries. It represented this relationship as not only strategic but also as an important
cushion for the Cuban economy, which went through a serious ordeal after losing Soviet support.
The alliance's portrayal does give an example, without a doubt, of how nations try to seek new
partners and alignments when the global political scene is changing.
Finally, the end of the Cold War ended the era of global bipolarity and marked the
beginning of an era of growing globalization and changes in international diplomacy. For Cuba,
it means a slow rapprochement with the world, away from isolation that had signaled so much of
its Cold War posturing. This is one of the very key transitions that happened in Cuba, which
helps to understand modern history and present socio-economic and political dynamics.
These broader themes of Cuba's shifting alliance and globalization approaches speak to
several themes discussed in our course on Latin American history and politics. The show is
associated with the discussion of the influence which the global environment might have over the
politics at the national level and relationships that would bind countries together in some certain
region of the world, like Latin America.
The episode may also ignite thinking about the current political world, whereby changes
in power dynamics and alliances continue to shape the relations between different nations. This
might raise questions as to whether such alliances have any future in a rapidly changing world
and how smaller nations thread their paths between global powers.
This film episode does pose some questions, to be sure. How sustainable is a dependence
of Cuba, for example, on countries like Venezuela, with its long-term implications for the
domestic policies and economic strategies of smaller nation-states that enter into alliances of
convenience with bigger powers? This is not only relevant for understanding the historical
course of Cuba but rather gives important insight into issues and problems with which most
countries are struggling in the globalized world today.
In the end, "The Cuba Libre Story, Episode 8" ultimately takes a nuanced look at the
post-Soviet international relations and internal developments of Cuba. It serves as a valuable
case study to delve into broader themes of political change, international alliances, and effects of
globalization that figure importantly in our course and for understanding the dynamics of modern
world affairs.

            "Life and Debt" is a documentary film by the director of Stephanie Black that gives a
trenchant look at the consequences of international economic policies, administered by such
bloodsucking financial bodies as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, on
a developing country seeking to shore up its economic standingᅳJamaica. With poignant
narrative from local workers, farmers, and officials, the film does not mince its words toward the
"new world order" and its often tragic impacts on such economies.
This documentary shows how outside economic policies, which normally come in to help
economic development, end up causing more harm than good with negative impacts that end up
increasing poverty and inequality. It properly captures the sharp contrast that is the intended
benevolence of global financial institutions, against the biting realities imposed on the everyday
Jamaican citizen. Their voices permeate the stories from the front lines of those most affected:
the small local farmers who are being edged out by cheaper imports, workers who break their
backs, and officials who are caught between international agency edicts and the welfare of their
people. Most of the weekly themes of discussions on the subject of globalization and economic
reform are reiterated in 'Life and Debt.' The movie is a clear exemplification of various
theoretical concepts, among them being economic dependency, neo-colonialism, and influence
from the global financial system on the local economies. In calling the viewer to question the
morality, as well as efficacy of globally enforced economic policies by powerful outside entities,
one not of the country's governance, Ouedraogo highlights for the viewer the multifaceted nature
of this power dynamic.
Under a broader context, this film raises an echo in today's global happenings, in the way
that poor or undeveloped countries still laboriously find their way out of a very similar economic
framework and priorities, in relation to paying back debt before public welfare. This definitely
leaves a pertinent question on the role and power play of international financial institutions in
global economics and their true accountability toward fostering equitable economic growth. 'Life
and Debt' also lets the viewers mirror on the deeper consequences such economic policies have
on the cultural and social structures. How can a national economy question issues of identity,
community cohesion, and long-term sustainable growth if it restructures itself under external
directorship? In light of these questions, the urgent need for policies that would be both
economically viable and socially and morally responsible is underscored.
To sum up , the film is not only in-depth into the ways class-discussed economic theories
have added but also calls the audience to critically appraise the efficiency and, actually, even
ethical considerations that international economic interventions have. In so many ways, this
documentary film powerfully reminds one of the human aspect behind statistics and economic
policies. In other words, "Life and Debt" is a strong, very valuable documentary film from
which one gets very valuable insight into a much more complicated interrelation of global
economic policies and their local consequences. It critically discloses the debate on principles
and results of international economic aid and, thus, represents an important contribution to the
discussion of the global economic structures and their effect

            LANDFALL" is one of the best films of 2020, a powerful reminder of both struggle and
resilience in Puerto Rico's post-Hurricane Maria recovery. The film weaves the tales of a
man-made natural disaster and an acute, pre-existing economic crisis that together document the
sometimes cozy, sometimes torturous relations between Puerto Rico and the United States.
"LANDFALL" is an incisive critique of disaster capitalism and colonial neglect set against the
intimacies of daily life and the communal response to exploitation and trauma.
The "LANDFALL" compares the body blow of physical devastation from Hurricane
María with the slow economic spiral marked by a $72 billion debt crisis. Its scenes capture a
series of fragmented but compelling stories across the island, some light in tone, others filled
with tapestries of perspectives from the plight of local Puerto Ricans to an opportunistic influx of
American investors. Against the dramatic setting of last year's historic series of protests that
forced the governor of Puerto Rico to resign, the film underscores a critical moment of political
and social reckoning.
More importantly, the documentary directly relates to several themes that have of our
course more particularly the mechanisms of colonialism and dynamics of power and resistance.
"LANDFALL" is a case in point to exhibit how all these external economic pressures and
policies do further the vulnerabilities of any colonized region and echo past patterns of
exploitation. The idea of disaster capitalism interrogated by the film offers another critical
framework in understanding how crises are set to deepen economic and political control, very
central to the discourses on global inequality and social justice.
The issues raised in "LANDFALL" are not local; rather, they depict the common big,
wider global challenges. The depicted struggle in Puerto Rico shown within the documentary
should be contrasted with other regions, under environmental-based disasters that are as a result
of political and economic instability. Other classes have looked at climate change issues which
are affecting the most vulnerable, while "LANDFALL" extends this through their emphasis on
environmental catastrophes that particularly affect the poor and colonized more than in other
places.
Despite its vivid illustration of the crises associated with Puerto Rico, "LANDFALL"
does pose questions on the scope of this narrative and the representation of multiple
stakeholders. One really wonders about the perspectives of those mainland investors and U.S.
policymakers regarding whether there were any good contributions or intentions behind their
actions or their minds were purely exploitative. And the film makes viewers wrestle with a very
important question of solutions: What can be done so that these communities are secured from
further abuse or animosity
"LANDFALL" plays the role of both documentary and informingly critical piece; it
brings out the compounded adversities that Puerto Rico actually had to face. It, on the other
hand, invites viewers into reflection on the intersections of hurricanes with economic crisis and
colonial dynamics. The film successfully presents these issues in such a way that it raises the
level of perception on such complex problems, demanding at the same time an informed and
sensitive reply to multifaceted crises. And as our survey of matters of power, resistance, and
justice continues, "LANDFALL" stands as yet one more case study for the unrelenting resolution
of communities moving through the chaos of the wake of environmental and economic storms.

            This documentary series "High on the Hog" goes into the rich history and cultural impact of
African American food, from African soil to the tables here in America. It is clear to indicate that
how varied the plantations were with their produce, so much that they even enjoyed the varied
culinary practices, like making cornbread kush—an ever-famous meal that tastes like today's
cereal. This tradition of culinary was a part and parcel of carrying the culture and resistance. To
the extent that even the host, Stephen Satterfield, said that the word "plantation" is problematic
to him on a personal level. It was the word containing the horrifying consequences of slavery,
torture, and Jim Crow laws. This queasiness highlights the larger story of African Americans'
relationship to southern heritage—a source of rich cultural tradition and a repository for the deep
wounds of racial trauma. It also talks about the importance of moving, particularly through a
perspective of a "last supper" in New Orleans. This meal represented the emotional and physical
leaving behind of the South during the Great Migration, in which African Americans looked for
new opportunities in the North while taking their culinary heritage with them. In a
post-documentary discussion, Stephen Satterfield, mistaken here as James Satterfield, discusses
the experience of "High on the Hog" experience. Raised in Atlanta, Georgia, literally in front of
culinary shows, innovations of his father, and always ready-to-eat cuisine, he developed the idea
that food is part of bringing love as a language and bond within family members. His paternal
grandmother died at a very young age, so it even stopped the tradition of the whole family
coming together for Sunday suppers. In the meanwhile, his dad took up the family chef spot and
further consolidated the idea that, indeed, cooking can be considered to be above and beyond the
scope of typical gender roles. Anybody can cook. The strong belief in the philosophy directed
Satterfield to apply for culinary school, and down the road, Oregon, where he took up with a
garage winemaker and learned the delicate detail of a vineyard and all about wine-making.
Throughout his career, Satterfield has always believed that cooking was an art form that could
bridge past to present, personal to collective histories, therefore making it a very powerful way
of telling stories and expressing culture.
"High on the Hog" is an outstanding example of the way in which African American cooking
traditions have been both influenced by and, at the same time, influenced larger dialogues of
American history. The documentary and post-film conversation with Stephen Satterfield they
host unveil the resilience of these traditions in shaping the American way of living today and
underscore an appreciation for the rooted relationship food has with identity and history.
